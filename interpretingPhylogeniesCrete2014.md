##Phylogeny Terminology and Concepts

###Notes

This exercise focuses on how we understand vocabulary and concepts associated with phylogenies and molecular evolution. By asking you to write down and discuss you understanding of several fundamental concepts and terms used in the field, the aim is to help highlight:

- the diversity amongst course participants, of our understanding of these different terms and concepts
- assumptions we make concerning these terms and concepts

It has been shown that considering an issue in several different ways e.g. (i) silently on your own (ii) in direct discussion with others or (iii) in a larger group discussion) tends to reinforce our ability to benefit from a given learning experience. Hence the structure of the exercise provided below.

###Exercise

A. Write down definitions/descriptions of the terms given in the list below (1-3).

Do this silently, on your own, and please actually write it down (on paper, or in a document on your computer) - formulating your ideas into words like this helps highlight aspects of the topic where your ideas are less clear (i.e. in this case, the parts of the definitions you find hardest to write are those which you feel less confident about)

It might help to begin by looking at the [Wikipedia page for phylogenetic trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree). If you do begin by consulting this page, please close the page when you write your own definitions/explanations of these terms, so that you don't find yourself just repeating what's already in the Wikipedia page.

Here are the terms:

1. phylogenetic tree
1. branch (of a phylogenetic tree)
1. root (of a rooted phylogenetic tree)

B. Once you've finished, compare your definitions with those of your neighbours.

Make notes on how your definitions differ, and write together a definition that agrees with both your ideas of the meaning of these terms.

C. We'll compare the definitions you have written together with [definitions we prepared before coming to the class](#SuggestedPhylogenyDefinitions) - we'll discuss together any ways in which these pre-prepared definitions differ with the ones you have come up with.

D. (If you quickly finish part A. of the exercise) Repeat the above steps, this time selecting two or more terms from the list below.

4. node (of a phylogenetic tree)
4. polytomy
4. sister group
4. subtree
4. taxonomic unit

If you're interested, you could consult these [definitions/explanations Alexis and I have written for these terms](./documents/phyloTerminologyTakenFromWileyDictionary.pdf).

###<a name="SuggestedPhylogenyDefinitions"></a>Suggested Definitions

**phylogenetic tree**: A description of a path of transmission of genetic information between a set of taxo.  
**branch** (of a phylogenetic tree): Lineages of taxonomic units that link nodes within a phylogenetic tree.  
**root** (of a rooted phylogenetic tree): In a rooted tree, the node that represents the most recent common ancestor taxon of all other taxa in the tree.
