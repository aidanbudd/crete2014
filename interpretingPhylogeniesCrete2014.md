##Phylogeny Terminology and Concepts
###Notes

Anyone who has worked with phylogenies before has had to work with the specific vocabulary and concepts of the field. When we first encounter these words and concepts, we have to actively make an effort to understand what is meant by them. But the more we work in the field, the more internalised and obvious becomes our understanding of them.

Not everyone, however, understands this vocabulary and concepts in the same way, something that can lead to misunderstanding and confusion when communicating about the topic.

The exercise below focuses on our basic understanding of  vocabulary and concepts associated with phylogenies and molecular evolution. By asking you to write down and discuss you understanding of several fundamental concepts and terms used in the field, the aim is to:

    highlight the diversity amongst the course participants, of our understanding of these different terms and concepts
    help you, and others, to reveal internalised/subconscious features and assumptions of your understanding of these terms and concepts
    highlight major differences in understanding of different concepts, and if these seem likely to be problematic for the rest of the course, a chance to discuss and address these differences together

Indeed, within any group, different people have different questions/issues/topics/problems with understanding a given topic. A better awareness, for both you and the trainers, of your specific most important learning outcomes/needs of the course has been shown to enhance the ability of students to improve their understanding as a result of attending a course. Thus, in more general terms, the aim of this exercises is to highlight, both for students and trainers, specific, different prior understandings of key topics in the field.

Note, also, it has been shown that thinking about a topic in several different "contexts" (e.g. (i) silently on your own (ii) in direct discussion with others or (iii) in a larger group discussion) tends to reinforce our ability to benefit from a given learning experience. Hence the structure of the exercise provided below.
Exercise

1. Write down definitions/descriptions of the terms given in the list below (A. - to C.).

Do this silently, on your own, and please actually write it down (on paper, in a document on your computer) - the act of committing your ideas into specific words often does a good job of making it clear where you are more and where less certain about how you want to express something.

It might help to begin by looking at the wikipedia page for phylogenetic trees. If you do begin by consulting this page, it would be best if you spend a bit of time looking through it, but then close the page when you write your own definitions/explanations of these terms, so that you don't find yourself just repeating what's already in the wikipedia page.

Here are the terms:

    phylogenetic tree
    phylogenetic tree topology
    branch length

2. Once you've finished, discuss your definitions with those of your neighbours.

Make notes on how your definitions differ, and write together a definition that agrees with both your ideas of the meaning of these terms.

3. We'll show definitions of these terms that we've come up with to the class - then we'll have a class discussion about any ways in which these definitions conflict with the ones you have come up with
4. Repeat the above steps, this time selecting two or more terms from the list below.

    branch (of a phylogenetic tree)
    node (of a phylogenetic tree)
    polytomy
    root
    sister group
    subtree
    taxonomic unit

In case you're interested, you could consult the definitions/explanations we've put together for these terms ourselves.
